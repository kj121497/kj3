# Interviewing In Context

### DH 150 Assignment 4 by Kimberly Jimenez

### Main Design Challenge

Users on Instagram freely post as much as they like onto their profiles; therefore, posts accumlate quickly, amounting to hundreds, even thousands. Accessing an old or a specific post (which can become lost if a user posts regularly) requires countless minutes and hours of scrolling. While this may be an accessible activity for profiles with few posts, a feature that chronologically sorts posts on profiles through dates (month and year) will allow users to access old posts with ease, save time, patience, and energy. As a result, cutting or elimanitng the amount of scrolling would be extremly helpful to experieced and inexperienced users alike.

### Target Users
 
The user to be interviewed will be between the ages of 18 to 29, a student or employee, proficient with technology, and experience using Instagram. The interview will take place in their home, at their desk or wherever they are most comfortable. Users will complete the activity on their mobile phone, preferably smart, with a connection to the Internet, and Instagram downloaded and ready-to-use.

To complete the acivity, the interviewee will ask the user to scroll two opposing profiles. The first, with less than five hundred posts. The second, with more than one thousand posts.
